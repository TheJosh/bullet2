<h1> Introduction to Dynamica </h1>

<p>
<h3>Rationale</h3>
Dynamica allows to perform rigid body simulations inside Maya, using different underlying libraries. Right now
only Bullet Physics is supported, but in the future other library will be added, such as NVidia PhysX. It will be possible
to switch between libraries on the fly. This will be useful for example when some parts of the simulation are particularly 
critical, requiring the need for a more precise (but slower library). It will still be possible to use a less precise (but faster)
library in the non-critical part of the simulation.
</p>

<p>
<h3>Basics</h3>
The functionality is provided by four types of custom Maya nodes that interact with each other: <b>dSolver</b>, <b>dRigidBody</b>,
<b>dRigidBodyArray</b>, <b>dCollisionShape</b>. The different nodes can be created thru the Dynamica UI. This UI can be accessed
by clicking on the Dynamica icon in the EfxToolsLumiere shelf.

<h5>dSolver</h5>
There is only one of this nodes per scene. It controls the global parameters of the simulation, such as time step, library used for
the simulation, ecc. It is created automatically every time a Rigid Body or a Rigid Body array is created.

<h5>dRigidBody</h5>
There can be multiple rigid bodies in the scene. It has different attributes that control it's behavior, such as mass, damping, 
initial position/velocity, ecc. 
It can be active or passive. An active rigid body is controlled by the forces and collisions in the simulation. A passive rigid 
body (sometimes called Kinematic) is just keyframed.
</p>

<h5>dCollisionShape</h5>
Represents the shape that is used to compute the collisions between rigid bodies. Every rigid body connects to a collision shape.  
Best practice is to use a collision shape that is good enough to represent the desired collision behavior. The simpler the collision
shape, the faster the simulation.
Currently the collision shape available are: sphere, box, infinite plane, convex hull, mesh. The convex hull collision shape and the  
mesh connect directly to a Maya mesh. The mesh collision shape is more precise for concave meshes, otherwise the convex hull shape should 
be used, because it's faster.
</body>

<h5>dRigidBodyArray</h5>
It's like a rigid body but can contain multiple rigid bodies sharing the same collision shape and simulation parameters. It's 
the node of choice when the rigid bodies have the same shape and speed is required. The attributes that control the initial configuration are:
<b>NumRigidBodies</b>, <b>InitialPosition (Multi)</b>, <b>InitialRotation (Multi)</b>, <b>InitialVelocity (Multi)</b>,  
<b>InitialSpin (Multi)</b>

<h3>Quick Start</h3>
The following are simple examples that show the basic functionalities of Dynamica. All the command can be accessed thru the Dynamica
UI from the EfxToolsLumiere shelf.

<h5>Simple rolling sphere</h5>
In the dynamica UI, click on "Create passive plane". It creates an infinite plane centered in (0,0,0). With the rotation manipulator,
tilt the plane a little bit. <br>
Deselect the plane. (<b>Important:</b> when creating a rigid body, if something is selected, the newly created rigid body has it's 
initial position and rotation set to the one of the selected object).
Click on "Create active sphere". It creates an active rigid body with a sphere as collision shape, centered in (0,0,0). With  
the move manipulator, move it up to (0,10,0). <br>
Now roll back the time slider to the first frame and hit play (Remember to extend the animation range as necessary). <br>
In general, it's good to roll back the animation to the first frame every time new objects are created, to allow everything to synch up.
By taking a look at the hypergraph for the rigid body, it's possible to have a better idea on how things are organized.

<h5>Arbitrary Mesh</h5>
Create a polygonal mesh in Maya, for example, an helix. With the helix still selected, click on "Create active Mesh". A new rigid body is created, 
with the helix as input to the Mesh collision shape. Alternatively, "Create active Convex Hull" could be used. The convex hull provides  
faster simulations at the expense of less precise collisions (if the input mesh is convex, the is no difference between Convex Hull and Mesh
collision shapes in term of precision).
Then repeat the same step of the Simple rolling sphere example.

<h5>Rigid Body Array</h5>
Create a maya polygonal mesh in Maya, for example a torus. Resize the torus so that the size of the bounding box is around 1x1x1.
With the torus still selected, hit "Create Active Rigid Body Array" in the UI. As small dialog box appears, asking for the dimensions    
of the array and the offset between the rigid bodies. Enter (10, 20, 10) for the dimensions and (2.5, 2.5, 2.5) as offset. <br>
Create a passive plane as before, then translate the rigid body array so that all donuts are above the plane. <br> 
Roll back the simulation, then hit play. <br> 
The initial configuration of the rigid body array can be changed by modifying the proper attributes, for example with a mel script.
The following is an example mel script that changes the initial configuration of a rigid body array: <br>
<pre>
proc setConfiguration()
{
    //the name of the rigid body array node
    string $rigidBodyArray = "myRigidBodyArray";    

    //set the number of bodies
    setAttr ($rigidBodyArray + ".numBodies") (10 * 10 * 10);
    for($i = 0; $i < 10; $i++) {
        for($j = 0; $j < 10; $j++) {
            for($k = 0; $k < 10; $k++) {
                //set the initial position
                setAttr ($children[0] + ".initialPosition[" + string($i + 10 * $j + 100 * $k) + "]") ($i * 2) (10 + $k * 2) ($j * 2);

                //set the initial rotation to (0, 0, 0)
                setAttr ($children[0] + ".initialRotation[" + string($i + 10 * $j + 100 * $k) + "]") 0 0 0;
            }
        }
    }
}
</pre>


<h5>Kinematic objects</h5>
Kinematic objects are handled by setting the keyframing the parent transform of a passive rigid body. If the keyframed animation is really fast,
it's possible that some object would leak thru the kinematic object. To reduce the problem, try increasing the number of substeps in the Solver
tab of the Dynamica UI or in the dSolver1 node. Note how the substeps attribute is keyable. This way, it's possible to set a different number of 
substeps all along the simulation, depending on how complicated it is at each time step, trading speed for accuracy.
