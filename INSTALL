Bullet Collision Detection and Physics Library

Compile

Under Windows, projectfiles for Visual Studio version 6,7,7.1 and 8 are available in msvc/<version>.
For example, for Visual Studio 2005, open msvc/8/wksbullet.sln

The ColladaDemo and ConvexDecomposition demo needs to be able to locate the data files (jenga.dae and file.obj) in the current directory. Make sure Visual Studio points to the right folder (..\..).


For other systems, for example Linux or Mac OS-X:

Download/install  CMake from www.cmake.org, and run cmake . -G Xcode (or replace Xcode with other available buildsystem).

Alternatively use make or jam:

./autogen.sh

./configure

jam or make

If jam is not available for your system, you can compile it, jam sources are included with the Bullet sources in jam-2.5

compiling jam:

cd jam-2.5

make

(as root)

su

make install
